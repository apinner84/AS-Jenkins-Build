# AS-Jenkins-Build
Use [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) to build B&amp;R Automation Studio Projects in a CD environment. Useful for larger projects with multiple developers working with Git.

Setup Jenkins Project to execute the batch script after whatever trigger you use (Merge into branch).

AS will need to be installed on the server alongside Jenkins and updated to the same level as the project.
